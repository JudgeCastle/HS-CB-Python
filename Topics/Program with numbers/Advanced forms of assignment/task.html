<p>Whenever you use an equal sign <code class="language-python">=</code>, you actually assign some value to a variable. For that reason, <code class="language-python">=</code> is typically referred to as an <strong>assignment operator</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are other assignment operators you can use in Python. They are also called <strong>compound assignment operators</strong>, for they carry out an arithmetic operation and assignment in one step. Have a look at the code snippet below:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># simple assignment
number = 10
number = number + 1  # 11</code></pre><p>This code is equivalent to the following one:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># compound assignment
number = 10
number += 1  # 11</code></pre><p>One can clearly see from the example that the second piece of code is more concise (for it doesn't repeat the variable's name).</p><p>Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations. Select all the options that contain compound assignment operators:</p>
