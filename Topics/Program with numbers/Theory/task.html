<p>Thus, we have shed some light on new details about integer arithmetic and the processing of numerical inputs in Python. The key takeaways are just two:</p><ul><li><p>We can convert the numeric user input with the help of <code class="java">int(input())</code> or <code class="java">float(input())</code></p></li><li><p>There are compound assignment operators, such as <code class="java">+=</code>, <code class="java">-=</code>, <code class="java">*=</code>, which make the code shorter and more readable.</p></li></ul><p>You definitely know a lot more on integer arithmetic, however, the learning journey of a developer is never over.</p>
